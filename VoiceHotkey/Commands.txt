#Anything starting with a "#" is a comment. The program will ignore these.
#=========================================================================================
#HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN COMMMANDS
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#Each line is made up of an Action Type, an Arguement, and (optionally) a Modifier
#Putting a bunch of lines makes a command
#
#The Action type dictates how the line should be interpreted, and the Arguement is what actually gets carried out.
#		- "Said" makes the computer listens for the specified text, and runs the rest of the lines in the command when it hears it.
#		- "Say" makes the computer speak
#		- "Run" will run whichever program you specify.
#		- "Type" will type the text that you specify
#		- "Press" will press the specified keys on your keyboard
#		- "Sleep" will pause the program for a specified number of seconds
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# <var> stands for variable. It will hold all the words you say between the defined words 
#		(Try the "My number" example, and it will make much more sense)
#
#There are also modifiers you can put at the end of some actions. They come after " --"
#		Works with the "Said" Action Type:
#			"--contains" 	- If what you said contains the specified phrase, the rest of the command runs
#			"--startsWith"	- If what you said starts with the specified phrase, the rest of the command runs
#			"--regex"		- If what you said is a regex match with the specified phrase, the rest of the command runs (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) 
#		Works with the "say" Action Type:
#			"--mute"		-Prints the specified text to the console, but doesn't actually say it out loud
#		Works with the "run" Action Type:
#			"--batch"		-Runs the arguement as a batch command rather than a program that needs to be opened.
